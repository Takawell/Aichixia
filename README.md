# 🌸 Aichixia  

**Aichixia** is the official API service powering **Aichiow**, an open-source platform that brings together anime, manga, manhwa, manhua, and light novels into one seamless ecosystem.  

More than just a data bridge, **Aichixia is designed as an AI-powered anime assistant API** — making it easier for developers and users to search, explore, and interact with anime-related content intelligently.  

It fetches and organizes data from sources like AniList and MangaDex, then provides simplified, structured, and ready-to-use endpoints for Aichiow and any other project that wants to integrate anime/manga data with AI assistance.
